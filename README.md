# chalice

was trying to learn chalice, so I built a backend for a car system where - 

1. Car Details -  Stored in DynammoDB
  - car-number
  - licence-number
  - car-brand
  - owner-name
  - date-of-purchase, etc. are store

2. Customer Details - Stored in MongoDB
  - license-number
  - name
  - age
  - address
  - phone-number
  - email
  - car-number

I've purposefully stored two tables in two seperate databases to better understand while learning.
 
 todo: 
  - Implement blueprints
  - Integrate ElasticSearch for searching.
